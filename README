ssqc <path/to/parm.file>
Script reads parameter file (see below) for a file indicating which sequences to process.

parm.file:
  paired-end true or false if sequence is paired end (note: collaps samples that cross lanes e.g., cat <name-L00[1-4]-R1.fastq.gz > name-R1.fastq.gz)
  fastq-files        </path/to/file> contains a list of fastq.gz files, paired ends alternate with naming convension name-R1.fastq.gz and name-R2.fastq.gz
  is_input   <integer> copies of internal standard added to sample.
  cc_expected        <integer> determined after several runs..expected count of unique CC sequences when no significant NT competition.
  nt2is </path/to/file> contains the mapping of NT to IS, base changes in lowercase
  ref </path/to/files> path to the reference genome
  split <true/false> determine if the NT and IS reads are to divided into separate bam and fastq

Program flow: read parameters; align reads; call remRecombinants; calculate coverage; create runQC table; calculate viral load
viral load calculated from total amplicon reads (NT + recombinants/2) / (IS + recombinant/2) * IS_INPUT
  Total recombinant amplicon reads should be half NT and half IS, hence the recombinant/2 contribution.
runQC uses the NT and IS CC-reads to adjust expected complexity capture (cc_expected) for competition.  Unique CC sequences calculated from -CC-counts.txt
Coverage calculated using bamstats amplicon counting method
